# SUNY - University Management System

## Project Overview
- After various deliberations between the team members, we decided that for our Visual Basic course, we will be developing a university application designed to assist students and professors in their operations. Specifically, our application is going to be developed for the State University of New York (SUNY), which has been a partner to UNYT for years.
- The reason we have chosen to develop such a program is because we have noticed a necessity to enable professors, students, as well as administration staff to have concise, precise data in real-time. Having this data available through our application, all these entities will be able to conduct their operations much more effortlessly. As mentioned, since our application would be dedicated to SUNY students and staff, the users that would interact with this system are:
  1. Admin</br>
  2. Professors</br>
  3. Students.</br>
  
- Inside the app, each of these users will have their own respective display with the list of options consisting of all their possible functionalities, designed to aid their day-to-day activities.
- Firstly, it is crucial to highlight the fact that before each of the actors accesses their own respective list of options, they are required to select their role, thus whether they are a student, professor, or admin. Once the actor has picked their role, they can proceed onto the next step: the log in.
- For all the users, no matter what their selected role is, in order to make use of their own functionalities, they need to first login by using their credentials: username and password. After the credentials are provided, a validation step is conducted to ensure that the data is correct. In the case of incorrect credentials, an error message-box would be displayed and the user will be prompted to reenter their credentials. Lastly, after effectively completing the login step, the usersare navigated to their respective list of options, where they can choose whatever operation to conduct.

## Project Management
- As mentioned in our previous section, we will be developing a university application designed to assist students and professors in their operations specifically for the State University of New York (SUNY). After considering various software process models, we have chosen to move forward with the incremental model. The incremental model in software development is an iterative approach to building software, where the development process is divided into smaller modules. Each module goes through the same stages of the software development life cycle, namely requirements gathering, design, development, testing and deployment. The reasons behind this decision are due to the numerous advantages that this process model offers. More specifically:
  - <b>Flexibility</b> → The incremental model allows for more flexibility in the development process, as each increment can be developed independently of the others. This means that we can easily accommodate change during the software development process, even after the requirements have been specified in the initial phase.
  - <b>Prompt validation and response</b> → Since every module goes through the whole software development lifecycle, it enables us to receive immediate validation and feedback on the software we have already developed for the client, which, in turn, aids us in detecting bugs and issues much earlier in the development cycle, where it’s easier to solve them.
  - <b>Rapid delivery and deployment</b> → The clients are able to use the desired software as early as possible, even with initial modules, if these modules provide the basic requirements.</br></br>
